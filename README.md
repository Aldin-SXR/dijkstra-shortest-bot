# Dijkstra's Shortest Quote Bot

A Telegram bot that spurts random quotes by [Edsger W. Dijkstra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edsger_W._Dijkstra) (and tells you that it loves you). 

Created as an exercise in bot design (and server setup), and written in PHP using [Telegram Bot API](https://packagist.org/packages/telegram-bot/api).

Start absorbing Dijkstra's wisdom by [clicking on this link.](https://t.me/dijkstra_shortest_bot).

## Commands

`/start` - Begin interacting with the bot.
`/quote` - Fetch and display a random quote.

I may add some other commands and features later.
